This is the compulsory Task 1 for Task 51 - Capstone Project VII: Unsupervised Machine Learning

This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge (link). A description of the
data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents,
for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the
percent of the population living in urban areas.”

Follow these steps:
● Use the dataset UsArrests.csv included in this folder to generate a similar
in-depth PCA report of the data. Explore as much as you can, motivate the
pre-processing steps you take, and interpret the outcomes of any analyses.
● You are also required to do an application of two clustering techniques and
an analysis of the clusters they generate. Try and see if you can find anything
common within each cluster that has been found.


Contents:

Statisitical summary of the dataset

Look at how our Data features correlate with one another

Boxplot for feature distributions

Showing how each component attributes itself to the explained variance

Cumulative variance plot

Scree plot

Create a graph to show the minimum number of components needed for our analysis

Create a barplot to visually represent how each Component affects the varience

Create biplot to represent Components within the total DataFrame

Hierarchical clustering

K-means clustering

Installation:
Download 'Task_51.ipynb' file
Use Jupyter notebook to run the script

Usage
Example of analysis on the minimum components should be used for the PCA
